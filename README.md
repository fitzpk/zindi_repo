## EARLY LEARNING PREDICTORS

Leaderboard Ranking: 11th

<a href=https://zindi.africa/competitions/datadrive2030-early-learning-predictors-challenge/>Competition Link</a>

In this competition, the challenge is to use machine learning techniques to identify which early learning programme factors contribute to better learning outcomes in children, by predicting a child’s ELOM score. Ultimately, this will allow DataDrive2030 to design better interventions that make optimal use of limited resources to ensure South Africa’s children are thriving.

Provided here is a simple starter script on how to approach the problem using a CatBoost Regressor.
